  _beginning:
  - When cleaning the bathroom
  - My intrusive thoughts took over
  - In the middle of a very boring shower
  - I wasn't paying attention
  - During a midnight snack
  - While brushing my teeth
  - I got hungry
  _middle:
  - I gave in to curiosity
  - I gave it a little lick
  - i chomped on it like it was a chocolate bar
  - I gave it a full kiss
  - It smelled like vanilla
  - I thought it was candy
  - The soap smelled so much like dessert
  _ending:
  - now I taste regret
  - now i burp bubbles
  - my breath smells like lavender
  - I have never felt so clean on the inside
  - My dreams tasted clean
  - I laughed bubbles instead of words
  - I learned nothing and would do it again
  - and I think I unlocked a secret menu at Lush
  _conclusion: []
